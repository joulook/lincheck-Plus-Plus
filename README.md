Lincheck++ is a framework that extends the capabilities of Lincheck, a user-friendly and practical tool for testing concurrent algorithms on the JVM. It is enhanced by the Trust algorithm[[1]](#1), which is a state-of-the-art optimal stateless model checking algorithm designed specifically for concurrent programs.
